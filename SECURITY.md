# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep this project secure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do **not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

For now, report privately to the maintainer first.
(We will replace this with an official security contact before public launch.)

Include:
- Affected version/commit
- Reproduction steps
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

## Response SLA (target)
- Initial acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage update: within 7 days
